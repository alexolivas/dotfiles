# Dotfiles Project #

The project contains all my home director's dotfiles (i.e. .bash_profile, .bashrc). The purpose of this project is so that I have these resources available and synced across all my computers.

### Setup ###

* Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/alexolivas-labs/dotfiles.git
```

TODO: Make the dotfiles_setup proejct executable from within dropbox
TODO: Update the project's working directory so they match in both computers
TODO: Create a script that creates a development environment directory (only if the directory/files aren't created)
TODO: Rename this project to something like bashfiles or bashscripts

* Run setup
```bash
dotfiles_setup
```
