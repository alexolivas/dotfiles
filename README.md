# Dotfiles Project #

The project contains all my home director's dotfiles (i.e. .bash_profile, .bashrc). The purpose of this project is so that I have these resources available and synced across all my computers.

### Setup ###

* Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://oaolivas@bitbucket.org/oaolivas/dotfiles.git
```

* Run setup
```bash
./dotfiles_setup
```
