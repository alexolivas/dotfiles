# Dotfiles Project #

The project contains all my home director's dotfiles (i.e. .bash_profile, .bashrc). The purpose of this project is so that I have these resources available and synced across all my computers.

### Setup ###

* Clone the project:
``bash
git clone https://oaolivas@bitbucket.org/oaolivas/dotfiles.git
``
* Give setup.sh execute permission: 
``bash
chmod u+x setup.sh
``
* Run setup to create symlinks in the user's home directory
``bash
./setup.sh
``
